## 📌 Overview

**Brainiac Query Assistant** is an intelligent SQL copilot that allows users to ask questions in natural language and receive optimized SQL queries in return.

Whether you're a data analyst, product manager, or BI specialist, this tool lets you:
- Query a relational MySQL database without writing SQL
- Understand complex schemas automatically
- Get fast insights using language you already know

This project was built as part of a practical AI course and is structured to simulate real-world banking data and queries.

---

## ⚙️ Features

- 🔍 Understands natural language and maps to SQL
- 🗃️ Connects to a MySQL relational database
- 🧠 Uses OpenAI's GPT-4 for query generation
- 📊 Displays query results instantly
- 🧾 Keeps history of interactions and feedback
- ❌ Prevents dangerous commands like `DROP`, `DELETE`, and `INSERT`

---

## 🧠 Prompt Capabilities

The underlying prompt used by the AI agent includes instructions to support:

- Conditional logic with `CASE WHEN`
- Filtering groups with `HAVING`
- Combining results with `UNION` / `UNION ALL`
- Using subqueries in `SELECT`, `WHERE`, or `FROM`
- Date operations using `DATE_FORMAT`, `DATEDIFF`, `NOW()`, etc.

## 🚀 How to Run

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Set up your environment

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
MYSQL_HOST=localhost
MYSQL_USER=root
MYSQL_PASSWORD=yourpassword
MYSQL_DB=dioBank
MYSQL_PORT=3306
```

### 3. Populate the database

```bash
python banco_de_dados/scripts/create_table.py
```

This script creates and fills the MySQL database with realistic dummy data using Faker.

### 4. Launch the app

```bash
streamlit run agente/scripts/streamlit_agent.py
```

Or use the terminal version:

```bash
python agente/scripts/terminal_agent.py
```

---

### 🧠 Advanced Query with JOIN and Aggregation
> Example: **"Top 5 clients who made the largest deposits"**  
> Demonstrates `JOIN`, `GROUP BY`, `SUM`, and `LIMIT`.

## 💬 Sample Questions

- "Show me the clients with the highest number of transactions"
- "What is the total payment value by city?"
- "List all withdrawals made in the last 30 days"
- "Which client had the largest transaction this year?"

---

## 🛡️ Safety & Restrictions

- No support for `INSERT`, `DELETE`, `DROP DATABASE`
- `UPDATE` only if there's a clear `WHERE` clause
- Responses return only SQL (no extra explanation)
- Prompt is structured for context, compliance, and reuse
